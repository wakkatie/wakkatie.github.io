            Our History (Lịch Sử Hình Thành)

            <div class="eng">
                The Vietnamese Alliance Church of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania began from a small number of families who loved Jesus Christ.
                Through earnest prayer and God’s will, this church was officially recognized on November 12, 1982
                by the Vietnamese Alliance District of the Christian and Missionary Alliance.
                In 1984, God provided the Colonial Park United Church of Christ where we could congregate at
                temporarily; however, we wanted a place where we could freely worship and seek the Lord -
                an established church of our own.  For many years, we relentlessly prayed for God to
                provide us with a church.  Many times we thought we had found a church, only to be met with hardships.
                Nonetheless, we continued to trust in God’s plan for this church.  On September 2006, nearly
                twenty-five years later, the Lord provided a place to establish our church firmly in the community.
                After many difficulties with financing, planning, and remodeling, the Vietnamese Alliance Church of
                Harrisburg had a place of worship on February 2, 2007.  We are forever grateful to the God who
                constantly loves, provides, and delivers his people.

                                    Mrs. Kim Loan Tran followed her husband to the Harrisburg area a few years ago.
                                    As a new wife, she felt a strong need for the women in the church to meet and grow
                                    together, supporting each other as sisters in Christ-thus she started the Women’s Fellowship Group.
                                    She also serves as a Bible Study Coordinator for the Young Adults.
                                    In her spare time, she enjoys eating out with her husband.
